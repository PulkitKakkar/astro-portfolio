  Paid Search Optimisation Across Swiggy Verticals

At Swiggy, I managed two separate Google Ads accounts tailored to different business verticals—restaurant delivery and quick-commerce. My objective was to drive efficient conversions and scale reach through well-structured and performance-optimised Paid Search campaigns.

The first step was restructuring both accounts to ensure logical segmentation by location, device, and intent. This allowed better control over budgets, bid strategies, and targeting granularity. I implemented a dual keyword strategy using both broad match (with smart bidding) to expand reach and discover new high-performing queries, and exact match to protect brand terms and convert high-intent traffic more efficiently.

I also conducted in-depth keyword audits to eliminate overlaps and non-performing terms while introducing long-tail, high-conversion phrases relevant to each vertical. Ad copies were rewritten to match user intent—emphasising speed, convenience, and value. For restaurant delivery, messaging focused on variety and fast delivery, while quick-commerce ads highlighted “Groceries in 15 Minutes” and “No Minimum Order”.

These changes led to:
*	12% increase in CTR across both accounts.
* 17% reduction in CPA, especially for high-intent campaigns.
* Improved Quality Scores through better ad relevance and landing page alignment.
* More scalable campaign performance driven by a cleaner, outcome-focused structure.

Through a combination of smart keyword match strategies, campaign structure refinement, and compelling ad creative, I helped Swiggy achieve measurable gains in both traffic quality and cost-efficiency.
