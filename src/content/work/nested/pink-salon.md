Pink Beauty Salon Ltd, a Reading-based small business, approached me with a clear objective: to increase local footfall for key services like laser hair removal, microblading, and Hydrafacial treatments—without exceeding a tight advertising budget.

After understanding the owner’s goals and target audience, I built the entire Google Ads strategy from scratch, starting with Search Ads that focused on high-intent, service-specific keywords like “laser hair removal Reading” and “Hydrafacial near me.” These campaigns were structured for maximum relevance and quality score, helping improve visibility within a limited spend.

Once we established traction, I introduced Performance Max campaigns to expand reach across YouTube, Maps, and Display, using carefully curated creatives and audience signals to attract more potential clients.

Despite the budget constraints, the campaigns delivered strong results in terms of reach, engagement, and bookings. The salon experienced a noticeable increase in enquiries and appointments—leading to significant business growth. Today, Pink Beauty Salon Ltd has expanded into one additional branches: one focusing exclusively on clinical treatments and another offering salon services, marking a major milestone that began with strategic paid advertising.
