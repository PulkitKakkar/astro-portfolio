As the dedicated Paid Search Analyst, I took ownership of Pink Beauty Salon's Google Ads account with a focus on Search, Shopping, and Performance Max campaigns. My approach was grounded in aligning campaign structure with business objectives—whether promoting their services the Reading showroom.

To maximise visibility and ROI, I:
* Conducted keyword and competitor research to shape tightly themed ad groups.
* Launched Performance Max campaigns to expand inventory reach and capture diverse intent signals.
* Implemented smart bidding strategies and audience segmentation for improved cost-efficiency.
* Continuously optimised campaigns by analysing CTR, CPA, and conversion volume trends.
* Delivered monthly performance reports with actionable insights, helping refine the business’s digital strategy.

Through these efforts, the campaigns delivered measurable improvements in store visits, product enquiries, and overall online visibility—making Google Ads a central driver of Pink Beauty Salon's growth in a highly niche market.
