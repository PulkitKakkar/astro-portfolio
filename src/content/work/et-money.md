For ET Money, a leading fintech app in India, the objective was to improve qualified lead generation and app engagement through a mix of Paid Search, Video Ads, and Performance Max campaigns. As the campaign manager, I took end-to-end ownership of strategy, execution, and optimisation across platforms.

My approach began with a comprehensive keyword audit, identifying gaps and opportunities to align our targeting with high-intent user search behavior. By refining match types, removing underperforming keywords, and integrating long-tail finance-related terms, I significantly improved relevance and reduced wasted spend.

On the creative side, I rewrote ad copies to focus on clarity, benefits, and urgency—emphasising features such as “Zero Commission Mutual Funds”, “Instant Tax Saving Options”, and “Secure App-Based Investing”. These copy changes resulted in higher CTRs and deeper engagement in both Search and Performance Max formats.

For Performance Max, I tailored asset groups by audience intent and funnel stage, ensuring that creative elements matched user expectations—from app-install video ads to transactional landing pages. I also ran targeted YouTube Ads highlighting key product benefits, improving brand recall and supporting conversion lift across search touchpoints.

As a result of these strategic changes:
* CTR improved by 35% on Search campaigns.
* CPA reduced by 28% across Performance Max.
* Video engagement rate increased by 42%, especially among new app users.
* Lead quality improved, with higher conversion-to-install rates in post-click analysis.

Through consistent optimisation, data-led decisions, and a refined multi-format ad strategy, I helped position ET Money’s campaigns for sustained, scalable growth.
