In my role as a Frontend Engineer for British Airways, I played a pivotal role in advancing the accessibility features of their website, leading several key redevelopment projects. My responsibilities centred around innovative problem-solving and efficient task management, strongly emphasising effective communication with senior management. This ensured that the team's development goals and training needs were clearly understood and met, significantly improving project results and team skillsets.

A significant aspect of my contribution was pioneering new front-end experiments and spearheading A/B testing. These initiatives were instrumental in identifying and implementing enhancements that directly contributed to increased sales and revenue growth for British Airways. My efforts improved the website's user experience and played a vital role in driving the company's commercial success.
