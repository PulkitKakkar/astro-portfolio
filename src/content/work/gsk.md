  Search Campaign Management for GSK – European Market

At Publicis Sapient, I managed the Google Ads Search campaigns for GSK across the European market, overseeing 20 individual accounts, each representing different pharmaceutical and consumer health products. The primary campaign objective was traffic acquisition, with a focus on maintaining consistent visibility and reach across multiple regions and languages.

I was responsible for daily budget pacing to ensure optimal spend distribution throughout the month, preventing overspend while maintaining competitive impression share across key markets.

All campaigns were Search-only, and I implemented regular performance audits to ensure top-performing keywords received adequate coverage while inefficient queries were excluded.

Through disciplined budget management and traffic-focused optimisation, I ensured stable delivery, consistent performance, and strong visibility across GSK’s multi-market portfolio—helping their digital presence remain active.
